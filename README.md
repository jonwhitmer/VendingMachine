# Vending Machine Project

## Description
The "Vending Machine" is a C++ application that simulates the operation of a vending machine. It manages inventory, tracks sales, and handles transactions while keeping track of various variables using pass by value and pass by reference principles.

## Features
- Simulate vending machine operations.
- Manage inventory of snacks and coins.
- Process transactions with real-time calculations.
- Keep track of sales and provide change.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as g++).
2. Compile the program: `g++ -o VendingMachine VendingMachine.cpp`.
3. Run the executable: `./VendingMachine` (on Unix-like systems) or `VendingMachine.exe` (on Windows).

## Usage
Follow the interactive prompts to select items, insert coins, and complete transactions. The program will guide you through each step, including selecting items, making payments, and receiving change.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
